# Stacking Ensemble based NIDS Framework

In the current repository, a file namely Testbed_Dataset.zip contains a synthetic network intrusion detection dataset. The dataset comprises many low footprint and stealth network attacks, collected using a simulated testbed network. The dataset includes six separate files contains Denial of Service, Arpspoof, Phishing, Bruteforce, Portscan attacks and Benign network traffic. This dataset is made public to the Network Intrusion Detection System(NIDS) research community. The researchers can use it to evaluate their own NIDS frameworks. 

A file in the current repository, namely NIDS_Source_Code.zip, includes python code files for developing a heterogeneous stacking ensemble based NIDS framework for detecting anomalous network traffic. 

In addition, the links for accessing the standard CICIDS-2017 dataset and the UNSW-NB15 dataset are also provided in the file name CICIDS2017_UNSW-NB15_Dataset_Link.
