# Staking-Ensemble-based-NIDS-Framework

In the current repository, a file namely Testbed_Dataset.zip contains a synthetic network intrusion detection dataset. The dataset comprises many low footprint and stealth network attacks collected using a simulated testbed network. The dataset includes six separate files contains Denial of Service, Arpspoof, Phishing, Bruteforce, Portscan attacks and Benign network traffic. This dataset is made public to the Network Intrusion Detection System(NIDS) research community. The researchers can use it to evaluate their own NIDS frameworks. 

Two other standard NIDS datasets links are also provided in a file name CICIDS2017_UNSW-NB15_Dataset_Link.
